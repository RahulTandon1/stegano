# stegano

I learnt the basics of the C# programming language and understood the MVC archictecture used in creating ASP.NET applications.

To put my knowledge to the test I created a basic web application to implement Steganography through the Least Significant Bit method (Steganography within itself it a whole field as I've recently come to understand).

I later added simple Caesar Cipher and Morse Code tools to get a better idea of MVC. 
The project name, however, is based on the first tool I put in the application.

## contents

- `learning-stuff/` - contains mini-projects and a markdown file that I used when learning C#, .NET and ASP.NET Core.

- steganoProj - the actual application I built.

- writeups - has a file called steganography.md that you should read __before__ you read the files in `CryptographyLogic`.

## Thank so much for reading :-)
Bye!
