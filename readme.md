# stegano

I learnt the basics of the C# programming language and understood the MVC archictecture used in creating ASP.NET applications.

To put my knowledge to the test I created a basic web application to implement Steganography through the Least Significant Bit method (Steganography within itself it a whole field as I've recently come to understand).

I later added simple Caesar Cipher and Morse Code tools to get a better idea of MVC. 
The project name, however, is based on the first tool I put in the application.

I made an extremely brief project report which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EnjAUwh4gUPRox8V8x4vIEI8digD2-wtcbynoIcLT3o/edit?usp=sharing).
