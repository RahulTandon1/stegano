# stegano

From September 26th to 23rd October I interned under Shelbin Kidangan of Cormsquare.
I learnt the basics of the C# programming language and understood the MVC archictecture used in creating ASP.NET applications.
To put my knowledge to the test I created a basic web application to implement Steganography through the Least Significant Bit method (Steganography within itself it a whole field as I've recently come to understand).

## contents

- `learning-stuff/` - contains mini-projects and a markdown file that I used when learning C#, .NET and ASP.NET Core.
- steganoProj - the actual application I built.

Bye!
